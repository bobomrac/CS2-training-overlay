# CS2-training-overlay
An amazing way to practice aim, positioning, angle check and gamesense. It is really hard to play with this but it makes you a god if you learn to master it. Written in python.
<br>
Use the build .bat file to convert into .exe or just run overlay.py (need to have python installed)
<br>
Toggle on/off - B (why? because you might want to see the shop interface)
<br>
Adjust size - ctrl + arrows
<br>
Adjust opacity - ctrl + page up/down
<br>
Quit - F12
<br>
